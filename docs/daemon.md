# Daemon

The daemon (`grite-daemon`) is optional and exists only to improve performance and coordination. Correctness never depends on it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Daemon auto-spawns on first command (no manual start needed)
grite issue list

# Manual control
grite daemon start --idle-timeout 300
grite daemon status
grite daemon stop

# Force local execution (skip daemon)
grite --no-daemon issue list
```

## Auto-Spawn

The daemon automatically spawns when you run CLI commands:

1. CLI connects to the IPC endpoint and asks the daemon to identify itself
2. If nothing answers, spawns `grite-daemon` in background
3. Waits for the daemon to answer a status round-trip (up to 10 seconds),
   watching the child process so an early exit is reported immediately
4. Routes command through IPC
5. Daemon runs until idle timeout

Default idle timeout is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

If the daemon cannot be reached or started, the CLI prints a warning naming
the cause and runs the command in-process. That fallback serialises poorly
under concurrency, so set `GRITE_REQUIRE_DAEMON=1` to make it a hard error
instead — concurrent agents should.

### Disabling Auto-Spawn

Use `--no-daemon` to force local execution:

```bash
grite --no-daemon issue list
```

## Idle Timeout

The daemon automatically shuts down after a period of inactivity:

```bash
# Start with 10-minute idle timeout
grite daemon start --idle-timeout 600

# Start with no timeout (runs until stopped)
grite daemon start --idle-timeout 0
```

The idle timer resets on each command. When timeout is reached:

1. Daemon logs "Idle timeout reached"
2. Workers shut down gracefully
3. All locks released
4. Process exits

## Responsibilities

- Maintain a warm materialized view for fast reads
- Handle concurrent CLI requests efficiently
- Refresh daemon lock heartbeat
- Release locks on shutdown

## Non-Responsibilities

- Never rewrites refs or force-pushes
- Never writes to the working tree
- Never becomes required for correctness
- No background sync (sync is explicit via `grite sync`)

```

### Supervisor

- Listens on IPC socket (`/tmp/grite-daemon.sock`)
- Routes requests to appropriate worker
- Manages worker lifecycle
- Tracks idle time for auto-shutdown

### Worker

- One worker per (repo, actor) pair
- Holds exclusive `flock` on sled database
- Spawns concurrent tokio tasks for commands
- Refreshes daemon lock heartbeat

## Concurrency

The daemon handles concurrent requests efficiently:

1. Supervisor receives IPC request
2. Routes to worker for (repo, actor)
3. Worker spawns tokio task
4. Sled MVCC handles concurrent access
5. Response sent back via IPC

Multiple CLI processes can issue commands simultaneously. The daemon serializes database access internally while allowing concurrent execution.

## Database Locking

### Filesystem Lock (flock)

The daemon acquires an exclusive `flock` on `sled.lock`:

```
.git/grite/actors/<actor_id>/sled.lock
```

This prevents other processes from opening the sled database while the daemon is running.

### Daemon Lock (ownership marker)

The daemon creates a JSON lock file for coordination:

```
.git/grite/actors/<actor_id>/daemon.lock
```

Example:

```json
{
  "pid": 12345,
  "started_ts": 1700000000000,
  "repo_root": "/path/to/repo",
  "actor_id": "64d15a2c383e2161772f9cea23e87222",
  "host_id": "hostname",
  "ipc_endpoint": "/tmp/grite-daemon.sock",
  "lease_ms": 30000,
  "last_heartbeat_ts": 1700000000000,
  "expires_ts": 1700000030000
}
```

### Lock Rules

The lock is a worker's advisory lease over the sled cache. It is **not** the
source of truth for whether a daemon is running: it is written lazily, when
the first repo-scoped command creates a worker, and it outlives a daemon that
crashed.

Liveness is decided by a `DaemonStatus` round-trip, never by the lock and
never by a bare `connect()`. A bare connect proves nothing: the kernel
completes the handshake from the listen backlog, so a daemon that is stopped,
paged out, or blocked still accepts connections while answering nothing. Only
a completed round-trip shows the daemon is making progress.

The lease does decide *which* daemon owns the store, so routing follows it
before falling back to the configured endpoint:

| Scenario | CLI Behavior |
|----------|--------------|
| A live lease whose endpoint answers | Route there — that daemon owns the store |
| No usable lease, configured endpoint answers | Route there |
| Lock holder process is gone | Remove the stale lock, auto-spawn |
| Nothing answers anywhere, live lease | Error naming the PID; `grite daemon stop` clears it |
| Endpoint occupied but silent | Treated as unusable; `start` reports the occupant instead of spawning a competitor that would lose the bind |

A lock is stale when its lease has expired **or** when the process that wrote
it no longer exists. The second condition matters: without it, a crashed
daemon blocks every command for the remainder of its 30-second lease.

## CLI Integration

### Status

```bash
$ grite daemon status
Daemon is running
  PID:            12345
  Host ID:        my-laptop
  IPC Endpoint:   /tmp/grite-daemon.sock
  Started:        2024-01-15 10:30:00 UTC
  Workers:        1
  State:          Running
```

### JSON Output

```bash
$ grite daemon status --json
{
  "running": true,
  "pid": 12345,
  "daemon_id": "9f2c...",
  "host_id": "my-laptop",
  "ipc_endpoint": "/tmp/grite-daemon.sock",
  "started_ts": 1705315800000,
  "worker_count": 1,
  "state": "Running",
  "lock": { "present": true, "pid": 12345, "stale": false, "holder_alive": true }
}
```

`daemon stop` exits non-zero if it could not confirm the daemon went away;
it exits 0 when there was nothing to stop. Note that `expires_ts`, `expired`
and `time_remaining_ms` now live under `lock` rather than at the top level,
and `pid`/`started_ts` describe the live daemon rather than the lease's
writer.

`running` reflects whether a daemon answered on the endpoint. The `lock`
object describes the cache lease and is informational only — a daemon that
has just started has `worker_count: 0` and no lock, and is still running.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `GRITE_DAEMON_SOCKET` | Override the IPC endpoint. Every process sharing a repository must agree on the value. |
| `GRITE_DAEMON_BIN` | Path to the `grite-daemon` executable. |
| `GRITE_REQUIRE_DAEMON=1` | Fail instead of falling back to in-process execution when the daemon is unreachable. |

## Failure Behavior

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Daemon crashes | Next command sees the holder PID is gone, clears the lock, and auto-spawns a replacement |
| Daemon wedged (stopped, paged out, blocked) | Reported as not running; `daemon stop` still delivers the shutdown, and `daemon start` reports the occupant rather than spawning a competitor |
| Lease unverifiable (foreign host, recycled PID) and its endpoint unserved | `grite daemon stop` clears it |
| Daemon fails to start | `daemon start` reports the child's exit status and the tail of `.git/grite/daemon.log` |
| IPC timeout | CLI retries 3 times, then errors |
| Worker panics | Supervisor continues, worker restarted on next request |
| Command error | Error returned via IPC, daemon continues |

## Logging

The daemon logs to stderr. Control verbosity with `--log-level`:

```bash
grite-daemon --log-level debug
```

Log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

When auto-spawned, daemon runs with `--log-level info` and stdout/stderr redirected to `/dev/null`.

## IPC Protocol

- Socket: `/tmp/grite-daemon.sock` (Unix domain socket)
- Framing: length-prefixed (`u32` BE + payload)
- Serialization: rkyv (zero-copy)
- Concurrency: one task per connection

See [IPC Protocol](ipc.md) for message format details.

## Configuration

The daemon reads configuration from:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables (for log level)

No configuration file is used. The daemon is stateless except for the workers it manages.

## Comparison: With vs Without Daemon

| Aspect | Without Daemon | With Daemon |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| First command latency | Higher (open sled) | Lower (sled warm) |
| Concurrent commands | Serialize at flock | Concurrent in daemon |
| Memory usage | Per-process | Shared in daemon |
| Complexity | Simple | More moving parts |
| Correctness | Same | Same |
