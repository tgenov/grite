**Git-backed issue tracking for coding agents and humans — distributed via npm.**

This package provides the `grite` and `grite-daemon` binaries as an npm-installable package. It is a thin wrapper around the native Rust binaries, automatically downloading the correct platform-specific binary during installation.

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g grite-cli

# Or install locally in a project
npm install --save-dev grite-cli
```

## Usage

Once installed, the `grite` and `grite-daemon` commands are available in your PATH:

```bash
# Initialize grite in a git repository
grite init

# Create an issue
grite issue create --title "Fix race condition" --label bug

# List issues
grite issue list

# Add a comment
grite issue comment <issue-id> --body "Working on this"

# Close an issue
grite issue close <issue-id>

# Sync with remote
grite sync
```

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| macOS | x86_64, ARM64, Universal | Supported |
| Linux | x86_64, ARM64 (glibc + musl) | Supported |
| Windows | x86_64, ARM64 | Planned |

The install script automatically detects your platform and downloads the appropriate binary.

## Requirements

- Node.js 14 or later
- Git 2.38 or later

## How It Works

This npm package contains an `install.js` script that runs during `npm install`. It:

1. Detects your operating system and CPU architecture
2. Downloads the matching pre-built binary from GitHub Releases
3. Places the binary in a platform-specific directory
4. Creates wrapper scripts in `node_modules/.bin/`

No compilation is required. The binaries are pure native code with zero runtime dependencies.
